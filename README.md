This is the git repository for the FFTW library for computing Fourier
transforms (version 3.x), maintained by the FFTW authors.

Unlike most other programs, most of the FFTW source code (in C) is
generated automatically.  This repository contains the *generator* and
it does not contain the *generated code*.  

Most users should download official tarballs from http://fftw.org/,
which contain the generated code and can be compiled on any system
with a C compiler.

Advanced users and FFTW maintainers can obtain code from github and
run the generation process themselves.  This is a long process that
requires special tools.  See README for details.
