* audit the implementation of RNK_MINFTY

* wisdom I/O

* real transforms

* I can't believe that there isn't a closed form for the omega
  array in Rader.

* simd

* threads/mpi

* DCT/DST ?  Idea: only implement the small cases as codelets,
  and reduce the rest to DFT via some known formula.  Multidimensional
  case is easy.  E.g., a fast 8x8 or 16x16 is still quite useful even
  if we cannot handle the general case efficiently.

* user interface

* merge genfft-k7 generator with the main genfft branch.
  genfft-k7 was written by Stefan Kral based on the fftw-2.1 genfft.

* implement fftw2 buffering: copy to buffers, transform in-place, copy back
