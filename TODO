* audit the implementation of RNK_MINFTY

* wisdom interaction with planner flags

* simd

* threads/mpi

* DCT/DST ?  Idea: only implement the small cases as codelets,
  and reduce the rest to DFT via some known formula.  Multidimensional
  case is easy.  E.g., a fast 8x8 or 16x16 is still quite useful even
  if we cannot handle the general case efficiently.

* user interface

* implement fftw2 buffering: copy to buffers, transform in-place, copy back

* --enable-long-double fails in verify().  The problem appears
  to be a bug in gcc-2.95 -malign-double.  The problem disappears
  with gcc-3.1, icc, and without -malign-double.  I couldn't figure
  out exactly what the problem is. 

* still too much code duplication in rader

* cleanup reodft/verify.c using kernel/verify-lib.c

TODO before/at release:

* remember to remove -no-randomized-cse from rdft codelets before
  final release.  This flag speeds up the generator but produces worse
  codelets

* remember to thank/acknowledge: Franz and Stefan, Aurora project
  in Vienna, MIT Lincoln Labs, Compaq/HP testdrive program,
  sourceforge, AMD for the athlon box.

TODO in the next release:

* investigate the addition-chain trig computation

* I can't believe that there isn't a closed form for the omega
  array in Rader.

* merge genfft-k7 generator with the main genfft branch.
  genfft-k7 was written by Stefan Kral based on the fftw-2.1 genfft.
