* audit the implementation of RNK_MINFTY

* dft/buffered.c is still wrong, because there is no sharing of
  buffers.  Maybe should malloc() the buffer in apply().

* define a printf-like function that understand plans.  E.g.

   plan_printf("(%s-%v %p)", name, veclen, child);

* define a naming scheme for solvers.  Use it for
  wisdom.  The idea is that wisdom is a map problem -> solver.
  Given problem, look up solver in wisdom, use solver to compute
  plan.
